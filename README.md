# Bot: PromptDialog options in the Dialog flow
Recently, I have come across an interesting support case scenario, where customer wanted to know whether bot users can be allowed to provide some other options (more humane) than just - yes/ no - in case of prompt dialog options. It was an interesting research work, where bulk of time spent in reviewing the PromptDialog class source code. Hence, some of the thought out scenarios are tried out.
